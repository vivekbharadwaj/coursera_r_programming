## notes about lexical scoping

let's say you assign the list created from makeVector to "v", here are some properties of v - 
* the list created in makeVector is actually a list of functions, not of the values generated by the functions
* so when you display the list, you get the functions and the environment they are stored in
* in accordance with list rules, you can get the contents of the elements in the list by either memory pointer or name i.e. v[[1]] or v$set will give the same value
function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
<environment: 0x00000000089c9e48>
* contrast this with v[1], which gives 
$set
function (y) 
{
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
}
<environment: 0x00000000089c9e48>
* to get an idea of what environment the variable is operating in, you can use the following 
 - environment(v$get) --> this will simply give the namespace of the environment <environment: 0x00000000089c9e48>
 - ls(environment(v$get)) --> this is like the ls -ltr operation and will list the variable in play in the environment 0x00000000089c9e48
* To get the data inside variables stored in the environment, reference the environment in the following manner - environment(v$var1)$x
* functions like getmean can be called from cachemean, and the return value from getmean can used in normal function usage. however, modifying their values are prhibited by external functions. that's why functions setmean and set don't behave in expected manner when assignment in makeVector is done using "<-" function. the lexical operator circumvents this issue by allowing modification in the global environment too.
